    <h3>Shackleton Sets Forth on Bold Antarctic Venture</h3>
    <h4>British Expedition Departs to Attempt First Crossing of the Frozen Continent</h4>


  <p><strong>London, Saturday</strong> — Sir Ernest Shackleton, already well known for his service in the cause of polar discovery, set his latest and most daring venture underway this morning as the expedition ship <em>Endurance</em> departed for the far South. His aim, announced earlier this year, is nothing less than the first complete overland crossing of Antarctica—a feat never previously attempted and one that, if successful, will stand among the greatest triumphs of exploration.</p>

  <p>In a brief statement issued before sailing, Sir Ernest expressed confidence in his men and the soundness of his preparations. “We go forth in the spirit of enterprise that has ever animated British exploration,” he said, adding that the trials ahead would be “severe but not insurmountable.”</p>

  <p>The <em>Endurance</em>, stoutly constructed for ice work, is provisioned for two years and carries 27 members, including scientists, sailors, and handlers for the dogs that will haul the sledges across the interior. Their intended route, from the Weddell Sea to the Ross Sea, will take them through some of the harshest and least known regions on the globe—territory where temperatures drop far below zero and storms rise without warning.</p>

  <p>Despite the ongoing war on the Continent, the Admiralty has permitted the expedition to proceed, evidently judging that the enterprise will continue the proud British tradition of peaceful scientific endeavour. Crowds gathered in good number along the quay to cheer the men as they cast off lines, waving hats and handkerchiefs despite the cold morning air.</p>

sWhether Shackleton’s bold design will succeed none can say. Yet his reputation for steady leadership and resourcefulness inspires considerable confidence. Whatever trials await them in the southern latitudes, the nation will watch their progress with keen interest.</p>
